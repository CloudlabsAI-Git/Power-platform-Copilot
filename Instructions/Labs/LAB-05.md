## Task-02: Add an owner to a cloud flow.

1.Adding an owner to a cloud flow is the most common way to share a cloud flow. Any owner of a cloud flow can perform these actions:
   
2.View the **run history**.
   
3.Manage the properties of the flow (for example, start or stop the flow, add owners, or update credentials for a connection).
   
4.Edit the definition of the flow (for example, add or remove an action or condition).
   
5.Add or remove other owners (but not the flow's creator), including guest users.

> Note: The creator or an owner of a cloud flow, you'll find it listed on the Team flows tab in Power Automate, Shared connections can be used only in the flow in which they were created.Owners can use services in a cloud flow but can't modify the credentials for a connection that another owner created.To add more owners to a cloud flow:

6.Sign in to **https://make.powerautomate.com/**, and then select **My flows**.

9. The user or group you've selected becomes an owner of the flow.


## Task-03: Add a list as a co-owner

You can add SharePoint lists as co-owners of a cloud flow so that everyone who has edit access to the list automatically gets edit access to the flow. After the flow is shared, you can simply distribute a link to it. 

1. Create and set up a SharePoint list.
   
2. Use a list when the flow is connected to SharePoint, and use a group in all other cases.

3.On the flow details page, in the Owners section, select **Edit**.
   
4.Select **Delete**(the trash can) for the owner you want to remove.
   
5.In the confirmation dialog box, select **Remove**.
